## MERN-mongoDB

This is a simple project in an endeavor to learn more MongoDB. While we did cover MongoDB during my coding bootcamp, we didn't spend much time actually working with it. Because of this I have sought out smaller and more managable projects to learn and get more experience with MongoDB.

## Useage

This is a very simple employee management web app that lets you add, delete, and edit new or existing employees in the database. It's styled very simplistically so this could potentially be reskinned and modified to make a more ellaborate project at some point in the future.
